This is a simple minesweeper game made using Python's tkinter gui library

GAME:
the game can be played by running the GameBoard.py file.

NOTES:
A short 'main' function is present at the bottom of the GameBoard.py file. 
Some parameters can be easily altered here to change the difficulty and scale
of the game being played.

Enjoy!
